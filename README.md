# Cafe-Co
A simple website that I created for a cafe that specializes in tea.
This project tested my knowledge in flex box, display and positioning. 
Additionally, It stregthened my knowledge of CSS selectors. 
This website is not responsive yet. I am curently learning and practicing responsive design.
It is my goal to use responsive design in my future front end projects. 
I am very proud of this website.
